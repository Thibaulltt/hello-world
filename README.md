# hello-world
This will be a repository for ideas, and feedback on other projects.

Currently, I'm in Uni, so not a whole lot will be happening.

First Idea : 
  - SoundCloud Player for Mac
  
Required Knowledge :
  - UI Conception
  - Swift General Knowledge
  - How to use f\*\*king XCode on macOS
  - Complete understanding of the Soundcloud APIs and SDKs

I'm fucked, aren't I ?
